"""
Integration tests for graph persistence with real Neo4j database.

ARCHITECTURAL NOTE (Post-Phase 1 Refactoring):
The save_analysis_to_graph function has been architecturally refactored to focus solely on:
1. Adding filename properties to existing sentences
2. Creating PART_OF_FILE relationships to SourceFile nodes
3. Creating FOLLOWS relationships between sequential sentences

Dimension relationships (FunctionType, StructureType, Purpose, Topics, Keywords) are now
handled by Neo4jAnalysisWriter to eliminate architectural duplication.

In the current architecture:
- Neo4jMapStorage creates Interview -[:HAS_SENTENCE]-> Sentence nodes
- Neo4jAnalysisWriter creates Analysis nodes and dimension relationships
- save_analysis_to_graph adds file-specific properties and relationships

Many tests below are commented out and need refactoring to follow this architectural flow.
