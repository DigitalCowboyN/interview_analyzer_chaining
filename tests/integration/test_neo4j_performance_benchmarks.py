"""
Comprehensive performance benchmarks for Neo4j integration components.

These tests measure and validate performance characteristics across different
scenarios and loads to establish baselines and identify bottlenecks:
- Single operation performance benchmarks
- Bulk operation throughput testing
- Concurrent operation scaling
- Memory usage and resource efficiency
- Query performance optimization validation
- Large dataset handling capabilities
