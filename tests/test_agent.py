"""
tests/test_agent.py

Contains unit tests for the `OpenAIAgent` class (`src.agents.agent.py`).

These tests verify:
    - Successful processing of valid API responses.
    - Correct retry logic for `RateLimitError` and generic `APIError`.
    - Correct exception handling for malformed/missing API response data.
    - Correct logging of retry attempts.
    - Initialization error handling.
    - Token usage tracking and metrics.
    - Edge cases and error scenarios.

Key Testing Techniques Used:
    - Asynchronous testing with `pytest-asyncio` (`@pytest.mark.asyncio`).
    - Fixtures (`agent`) for creating test instances.
    - Patching asynchronous methods (`agent.client.responses.create`) with `AsyncMock`.
    - Testing expected exceptions using `pytest.raises`.
    - Capturing log output using the `caplog` fixture.
