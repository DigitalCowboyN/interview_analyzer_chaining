# Testing Progress Report

## Summary

Started comprehensive testing of Phase 2 event-sourced architecture components. **Found and fixed 1 critical bug** in the first test suite.

---

## Test Coverage

### ✅ M2.1: Command Layer
**Status:** 8/8 tests passing (100%)

**Files Tested:**
- `src/commands/handlers.py` - InterviewCommandHandler, SentenceCommandHandler

**Tests Created:**
- `tests/commands/test_command_handlers_unit.py` (8 tests)
  - Interview creation, updates, status changes
  - Sentence creation, edits, analysis generation
  - Validation errors (already exists, not found, invalid values)
  - Actor tracking and correlation IDs

**Bugs Found:**
1. **CRITICAL: Version calculation bug in `AggregateRoot._add_event()`**
   - **Impact:** Would cause event version collisions, data loss, broken idempotency
   - **Root Cause:** Used `len(_uncommitted_events)` instead of `self.version + 1`
   - **Fix:** Changed to `self.version + 1` for correct version incrementing
   - **Status:** Fixed and tested

---

### ⏳ M2.3: Projection Infrastructure
**Status:** 0 tests (NOT STARTED)

**Components to Test:**
- Lane Manager (partitioning logic, queue management)
- Subscription Manager (ESDB connection, event filtering)
- Parked Events Manager (DLQ operations)

**High-Risk Areas:**
- Partitioning by `interview_id` (hash collision, distribution)
- Queue depth management (memory leaks, blocking)
- Event filtering (allowlist logic)
- Checkpoint management (resume from correct position)

---

### ⏳ M2.4: Projection Handlers
**Status:** 0 tests (NOT STARTED)

**Components to Test:**
- Base Handler (version checking, retry logic, parking)
- Interview Handlers (InterviewCreated, StatusChanged, etc.)
- Sentence Handlers (SentenceCreated, SentenceEdited, AnalysisGenerated, etc.)

**High-Risk Areas:**
- Version guards (idempotency)
- Neo4j query correctness (relationships, properties)
- Retry-to-park logic (exponential backoff, max attempts)
- Error handling (transient vs permanent failures)

---

### ⏳ M2.5: Monitoring
**Status:** 0 tests (NOT STARTED)

**Components to Test:**
- Metrics tracking (counters, gauges, histograms)
- Health check endpoint (status aggregation)

**Lower Risk:** Monitoring failures don't affect core functionality

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Mocked Dependencies)
✅ **Completed:** Command handlers
⏳ **Next:** Lane manager, handlers

**Approach:**
- Mock EventStoreDB client
- Mock Neo4j sessions
- Test business logic in isolation
- Fast execution, no external dependencies

### Integration Tests (Real Services)
⏳ **Not Started**

**Approach:**
- Use test containers (EventStoreDB, Neo4j)
- Test end-to-end flows
- Validate integration points
- Slower, but catches integration bugs

---

## Bugs Found So Far

### 1. Version Calculation Bug (CRITICAL)
**File:** `src/events/aggregates.py:107`
**Severity:** Critical - Would cause data corruption
**Status:** Fixed

**Details:**
```python
# BEFORE (WRONG):
new_version = len(self._uncommitted_events)  # Resets to 0 after commit!

# AFTER (CORRECT):
new_version = self.version + 1  # Increments from last committed version
```

**Impact:**
- Event version collisions when editing existing aggregates
- Optimistic concurrency control would fail
- Event replay would be incorrect
- Data loss in production

**How Found:** Unit test `test_edit_sentence_success` expected version 1 but got version 0

---

## Next Steps

### Option A: Continue Unit Testing (Recommended)
1. **Lane Manager Tests** (~1 hour)
   - Test partitioning logic (interview_id → lane)
   - Test queue management
   - Test concurrent event processing

2. **Projection Handler Tests** (~2 hours)
   - Test version checking (idempotency)
   - Test Neo4j queries (mocked sessions)
   - Test retry-to-park logic
   - Test all event types

3. **Integration Tests** (~2 hours)
   - Set up test containers
   - Test end-to-end event flow
   - Test projection replay
   - Test error scenarios

**Total Time:** ~5 hours
**Benefit:** High confidence, catch bugs early

### Option B: Minimal Testing + Continue Implementation
1. **Write smoke tests only** (~30 minutes)
2. **Proceed to M2.2** (Dual-Write Integration)
3. **Test via end-to-end execution**

**Total Time:** ~30 minutes
**Risk:** May discover bugs later that require rework

---

## Recommendation

**Continue with comprehensive testing (Option A).**

**Rationale:**
1. We already found 1 critical bug in the first test suite
2. Projection infrastructure is complex (lanes, partitioning, retry logic)
3. Neo4j queries are error-prone (relationships, version guards)
4. Fixing bugs now is cheaper than fixing them after M2.2 integration
5. Tests serve as documentation for how components should work

**The bug we found validates this approach** - without tests, this version collision bug would have made it to production and caused serious data corruption.

---

## Test Metrics

- **Tests Written:** 8
- **Tests Passing:** 8 (100%)
- **Bugs Found:** 1 critical
- **Code Coverage:** ~30% of M2.1, 0% of M2.3-M2.5
- **Time Invested:** ~1 hour
- **ROI:** Prevented 1 critical production bug

---

## Conclusion

Testing is working exactly as intended:
- ✅ Found real bugs
- ✅ Validated business logic
- ✅ Provided confidence in code quality
- ✅ Served as executable documentation

**We should continue testing before proceeding to M2.2.**
