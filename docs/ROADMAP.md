## Dependency Upgrade Schedule

| Package | Current | Target | Milestone | Rationale |
|---------|---------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| neo4j | 5.28.1 | 6.x | **M3.0** | Vector types; single write path |
| openai | 1.93.3 | 2.x | **M3.2** | Agents SDK; function outputs |
| anthropic | >=0.39.0 | Latest | **M3.2** | Keep in sync |
| pytest | 8.3.3 | 9.x | M3.3 | Dev tooling |
| pytest-cov | 6.0.0 | 7.x | M3.3 | Dev tooling |
| redis | 6.2.0 | 7.x | M3.3 | Performance |
| isort | 5.13.2 | 7.x | M3.3 | Dev tooling |

## Technical Debt

### Post-M3.0 Cleanup
- [ ] Remove 27 legacy tests (test_neo4j_analysis_writer_legacy.py)
- [ ] Remove deprecated Neo4jMapStorage direct write code
- [ ] Remove deprecated Neo4jAnalysisWriter direct write code
- [ ] Update 11 data integrity tests for eventual consistency
- [ ] Rewrite 5 fault tolerance tests for EventStoreDB

### Future Improvements (Unprioritized)
- [ ] Prometheus metrics exporter (currently in-memory)
- [ ] WebSocket for real-time Neo4j updates
- [ ] CLI tool for replaying parked events
- [ ] Event schema versioning and migration
- [ ] OpenTelemetry distributed tracing
- [ ] Neo4j query optimization for bulk operations
- [ ] Circuit breaker for Neo4j connection failures
- [ ] Event archival/compaction strategy

## Architecture Overview

```
Current State (M2.8 - Dual-Write)
─────────────────────────────────
User Upload / Edit API
    ↓
Pipeline / Command Handlers
    ├──→ EventStoreDB (events) ← Source of Truth
    └──→ Neo4j (direct write)  ← Temporary (removed in M3.0)

EventStoreDB
    ↓
Projection Service
    ↓
Neo4j (materialized view)


Target State (M3.0 - Single-Writer)
────────────────────────────────────
User Upload / Edit API
    ↓
Pipeline / Command Handlers
    └──→ EventStoreDB (events only)

EventStoreDB
    ↓
Projection Service
    ↓
Neo4j (sole writer)
```

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-01-18 | Bundle neo4j 6.x with M3.0 | Single write path simplifies migration |
| 2026-01-18 | Separate openai 2.x to M3.2 | Orthogonal to event-sourcing; needs dedicated focus |
| 2026-01-18 | Defer pytest/redis to M3.3 | No immediate benefit; low priority |
| 2026-01-18 | Plan vector search for M3.1 | Requires neo4j 6.x vector types |
