# Phase 2: EventStoreDB Integration - COMPLETE ✅

**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Status:** Complete - All command handler tests passing

---

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. EventStoreDB Connection String

**Issue:** Code defaulted to `localhost:2113` instead of reading from environment  
**Fix:** Updated `get_event_store_client()` in `src/events/store.py` to read `ESDB_CONNECTION_STRING` env var  
**Default:** Now uses `esdb://eventstore:2113?tls=false` for Docker environment

### 2. Stream Creation - StreamState Handling

**Issue:** Code tried to pass `expected_version=-1` which caused assertion error  
**Fix:** Use `StreamState.NO_STREAM` constant for new stream creation  
**Location:** `src/events/store.py:182-183`

### 3. Stream Not Found Exception Handling

**Issue:** `NotFound` exception raised during iteration, not caught properly  
**Fix:** Added try/catch within the iteration loop to catch and convert to `StreamNotFoundError`  
**Location:** `src/events/store.py:251-258`

### 4. Repository Expected Version Calculation

**Issue:** New aggregates passed version=0 but stream doesn't exist (needs -1)  
**Fix:** Calculate version before uncommitted events were added, use -1 for new streams  
**Location:** `src/events/repository.py:106-115`

### 5. Synchronous vs Asynchronous API

**Issue:** Incorrectly used `await` on `client.append_to_stream()` which is synchronous  
**Fix:** Removed `await` keyword  
**Location:** `src/events/store.py:182-189`

### 6. Event Count After Save

**Issue:** `get_uncommitted_events()` returns empty list after `repo.save()` clears them  
**Fix:** Capture event count BEFORE calling `repo.save()`  
**Location:** `src/commands/handlers.py` (multiple handlers)

## Files Modified

### Core Event Store Files

- `src/events/store.py` - Fixed connection string, StreamState usage, exception handling
- `src/events/repository.py` - Fixed expected_version calculation for new streams
- `src/commands/handlers.py` - Fixed event_count capture timing

### Infrastructure Files

- `.env` - Added EventStoreDB and Projection Service configuration
- `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` - Added projection-service to runServices
- `.devcontainer/devcontainer.env` - Added EventStore configuration
- `Makefile` - Added EventStoreDB management targets (eventstore-up, eventstore-down, eventstore-health, etc.)

## Test Results

### ✅ Passing Tests (3/3)

```bash
tests/commands/test_command_handlers.py::TestInterviewCommandHandler::test_create_interview_command PASSED
tests/commands/test_command_handlers.py::TestSentenceCommandHandler::test_create_sentence_command PASSED
tests/commands/test_command_handlers.py::TestSentenceCommandHandler::test_edit_sentence_command PASSED
```

### EventStoreDB Status

- Health: ✅ Healthy
- Connection: ✅ Accessible at `eventstore:2113`
- Streams Created: ✅ Can create new streams with proper version handling

## New Makefile Targets

```bash
# EventStoreDB Management
make eventstore-up          # Start EventStoreDB
make eventstore-down        # Stop EventStoreDB
make eventstore-health      # Check health status
make eventstore-logs        # View logs
make eventstore-restart     # Restart service
make eventstore-clear       # Delete all data (with confirmation)

# Event Sourcing System
make es-up                  # Start EventStore + Projection Service
make es-down                # Stop both services
make es-status              # Check status of both
make es-logs                # Tail logs from both

# Testing
make test-eventstore        # Run EventStore-dependent tests
make test-e2e               # Run end-to-end integration tests
make test-projections       # Run projection-related tests
```

---

## Environment Variables Added

```bash
# EventStoreDB Configuration
ESDB_CONNECTION_STRING=esdb://eventstore:2113?tls=false

# Projection Service Configuration
ENABLE_PROJECTION_SERVICE=true
PROJECTION_LANE_COUNT=12
PROJECTION_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS=5
PROJECTION_CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL=100
```

## What's Working Now

1. ✅ EventStoreDB running and healthy
2. ✅ Connection from app container to EventStore service
3. ✅ Creating new interview aggregates and saving to EventStore
4. ✅ Creating new sentence aggregates and saving to EventStore
5. ✅ Editing sentences and appending events to existing streams
6. ✅ Proper stream versioning and optimistic concurrency control
7. ✅ Command handlers successfully process commands and emit events

---

## Next Steps (Phase 3)

1. Verify projection service is running
2. Test event consumption from EventStoreDB
3. Validate projections are writing to Neo4j
4. Run end-to-end workflow test
5. Monitor projection lag and throughput

---

## Technical Details

### Stream Naming Convention

- Interviews: `Interview-{uuid}`
- Sentences: `Sentence-{uuid}`

### Event Versioning

- New streams start at version -1 (using `StreamState.NO_STREAM`)
- First event creates stream at version 0
- Subsequent events increment version sequentially
- Repository tracks uncommitted events and clears them after successful save

### Error Handling

- `NotFound` → `StreamNotFoundError` (expected for new aggregates)
- `WrongCurrentVersion` → `ConcurrencyError` (optimistic locking conflict)
- All other exceptions → `EventStoreError`

**Phase 2 Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Ready for Phase 3:** ✅ YES  
**Confidence Level:** HIGH
