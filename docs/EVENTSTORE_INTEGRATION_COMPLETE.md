## 🔧 Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. EventStoreDB Connection String

**Problem:** Code defaulted to `localhost:2113` instead of docker service  
**Solution:** Updated `get_event_store_client()` to read `ESDB_CONNECTION_STRING` from environment  
**Impact:** Tests can now connect to EventStore in Docker environment

### 2. Stream Creation - StreamState Constant

**Problem:** Tried to pass `-1` as version, caused assertion error in esdbclient  
**Solution:** Use `StreamState.NO_STREAM` constant for new streams  
**Impact:** Can now create new event streams without errors

### 3. Stream Not Found Exception

**Problem:** `NotFound` exception raised during event iteration, not caught  
**Solution:** Added try/catch within iteration loop to handle stream-not-found gracefully  
**Impact:** New aggregates can be created without errors

### 4. Repository Version Calculation

**Problem:** New aggregates passed `expected_version=0` but stream doesn't exist  
**Solution:** Calculate version before uncommitted events, use `-1` for new streams  
**Impact:** Proper versioning for both new and existing aggregates

### 5. Async vs Sync API Confusion

**Problem:** Used `await` on synchronous `client.append_to_stream()`  
**Solution:** Removed incorrect `await` keyword  
**Impact:** Event appending now works correctly

### 6. Event Count Timing Bug

**Problem:** `get_uncommitted_events()` called after `repo.save()` clears events  
**Solution:** Capture event count BEFORE saving  
**Impact:** Command results now show correct event counts

### What's Working Now ✅

1. ✅ File upload → Events to EventStoreDB
2. ✅ File upload → Direct write to Neo4j (existing)
3. ✅ User edits → Events to EventStoreDB (via API)
4. ✅ Command handlers process commands correctly
5. ✅ Proper event versioning and concurrency control
6. ✅ Event stream creation and appending
7. ✅ Projection handlers ready (unit tested)

### What's Next ⏳

- Projection service live event consumption (configured but needs verification)
- End-to-end validation with projection writes
- Production monitoring (1-2 weeks)
- Remove dual-write (Phase M2.8)

## 🧪 Test Error Analysis

### 129 Errors Explained

All 129 errors are from tests attempting to run `make db-test-up` from inside the app container. This is expected because:

1. **Environment Context:** We're running tests inside the app container
2. **Docker Unavailable:** The app container doesn't have docker/docker-compose commands
3. **Test Design:** These tests are designed to run from:
   - Host machine (outside container)
   - CI/CD environment with docker-in-docker
   - Dev environment with full docker access

### Affected Test Categories

| Test Suite                             | Errors | Reason                        |

| `test_neo4j_analysis_writer.py`        | 51     | Needs neo4j-test service      |
| `test_neo4j_connection_reliability.py` | 12     | Needs neo4j-test service      |
| `test_neo4j_data_integrity.py`         | 10     | Needs neo4j-test service      |
| `test_neo4j_fault_tolerance.py`        | 7      | Needs neo4j-test service      |
| `test_neo4j_map_storage.py`            | 8      | Needs neo4j-test service      |
| `test_neo4j_performance_benchmarks.py` | 6      | Needs neo4j-test service      |
| `test_e2e_*.py`                        | 6      | Needs full docker environment |
| `test_projection_replay.py`            | 3      | Needs EventStore + Neo4j      |
| `test_idempotency.py`                  | 6      | Needs EventStore + Neo4j      |
| `test_performance.py`                  | 6      | Needs EventStore + Neo4j      |
| Others                                 | 14     | Needs test database           |

### Running These Tests

**From Host Machine:**

```bash
# Ensure all services are running
docker compose up -d

# Run the full test suite
docker compose exec app pytest tests/ -v --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Or use Makefile
make test
```

**In CI/CD:**
Tests will run automatically when docker-in-docker is available.

3. ⏳ **PENDING** - Verify projection service running (outside container)

### Short-Term (1-2 days)

4. Run projection service and verify event consumption
5. Test end-to-end workflow: upload → events → projections → Neo4j
6. Monitor projection lag and throughput
7. Validate data consistency (direct write vs projection write)

### Medium-Term (1-2 weeks)

8. Production validation with dual-write enabled
9. Monitor for data discrepancies
10. Measure performance under real load
11. Fine-tune projection service settings

### Long-Term (1-2 months)

12. **Phase M2.8:** Remove dual-write after successful validation
13. Projection service becomes sole Neo4j writer
14. Keep feature flag for emergency rollback
