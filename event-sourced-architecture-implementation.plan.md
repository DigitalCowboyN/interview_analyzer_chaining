## Milestone Details

### M1: Core Event-Sourcing Plumbing ✅

**Status:** COMPLETE (61 tests passing)

**Components Built:**
1. Event envelope design with comprehensive metadata
2. EventStoreDB integration with retry logic
3. Repository pattern with optimistic concurrency control
4. Interview and Sentence aggregates with event sourcing
5. Domain events for all operations

**Critical Bug Fixed:** Version calculation in `AggregateRoot._add_event()` would have caused event version collisions.

---

### M2.1: Command Layer ✅

**Status:** COMPLETE (8 tests passing)

**Components Built:**
- Command DTOs for all operations
- Command handlers with validation
- Factory pattern for repository creation
- Actor tracking and correlation IDs

**Tests:** 8 unit tests validating command processing, error handling, and event generation.

---

### M2.2: Dual-Write Integration ✅

**Status:** COMPLETE (20 tests passing: 10 unit + 10 integration)

**Components Built:**
1. `PipelineEventEmitter` - Lightweight wrapper for event emission
2. Pipeline integration for `InterviewCreated`, `SentenceCreated`, `AnalysisGenerated` events
3. Neo4j storage integration with event emission
4. Non-blocking error handling

**Key Features:**
- Deterministic sentence UUIDs (uuid5)
- System actor tracking
- Correlation ID propagation
- Feature-flagged (safe to enable/disable)

---

### M2.3: Projection Infrastructure ✅

**Status:** COMPLETE (15 tests passing)

**Components Built:**
1. `LaneManager` - 12 parallel processing lanes with consistent hashing
2. `SubscriptionManager` - EventStoreDB persistent subscriptions
3. `ParkedEventsManager` - Dead letter queue for failed events
4. `ProjectionService` - Orchestration and health checks

**Tests:** Validate partitioning, in-order processing, lane lifecycle, and status monitoring.

---

### M2.4: Projection Handlers ✅

**Status:** COMPLETE (11 tests passing)

**Components Built:**
1. `BaseProjectionHandler` - Version guards and retry-to-park logic
2. Interview handlers (Created, MetadataUpdated, StatusChanged)
3. Sentence handlers (Created, Edited, AnalysisGenerated)

**Tests:** Validate idempotency, retry logic, version checking, and Neo4j projection.

---

### M2.5: Monitoring & Observability ✅

**Status:** CODE COMPLETE (no dedicated tests, covered by integration)

**Components Built:**
1. Metrics collection (Prometheus-style)
2. Health check endpoints
3. Structured logging for DLQ events
4. Per-lane status monitoring

---

### M2.6: User Edit API ✅ NEW

**Status:** COMPLETE (16 tests passing)

**Components Built:**

1. **Edit Endpoints** (`src/api/routers/edits.py` - 360 lines)
   - `POST /edits/sentences/{interview_id}/{sentence_index}/edit` - Edit sentence text
   - `POST /edits/sentences/{interview_id}/{sentence_index}/analysis/override` - Override analysis
   - `GET /edits/sentences/{interview_id}/{sentence_index}/history` - Get edit history

2. **Features:**
   - Command-based (integrates with M2.1 command handlers)
   - Actor tracking via X-User-ID header
   - Correlation ID support via X-Correlation-ID header
   - Deterministic sentence UUIDs
   - Comprehensive error handling (404, 400, 500)

3. **Tests** (`tests/api/test_edit_api_unit.py` - 608 lines, 16/16 passing)
   - EditSentenceEndpoint: 6 tests
   - OverrideAnalysisEndpoint: 5 tests
   - GetSentenceHistoryEndpoint: 2 tests
   - CreateActorFromRequest: 3 tests

**Validation:**
- ✅ Success paths (edit sentence, override analysis, get history)
- ✅ Error handling (not found, validation errors, internal errors)
- ✅ Edge cases (anonymous users, missing IDs)
- ✅ Command construction and field mapping
- ✅ Actor tracking (HUMAN vs SYSTEM)

---

### M2.7: Testing & Validation ⏳

**Status:** IN PROGRESS

**Scope:**
1. End-to-end file processing tests with events
2. Projection replay validation
3. User edit scenarios (edit → projection → Neo4j verification)
4. Idempotency testing (replay same events)
5. Event ordering validation
6. Parked event handling tests
7. Performance validation under load

**Deliverables:**
- Comprehensive integration test suite
- Performance benchmarks
- Data consistency validation

**Dependencies:** M2.2 (Dual-Write) ✅, M2.6 (User Edit API) ✅

---

### M2.8: Remove Dual-Write ⏳

**Status:** NOT STARTED (blocked by M2.7)

**Scope:**
1. Remove direct Neo4j writes from pipeline
2. Projection service becomes sole writer
3. Feature flag for safety (`dual_write_mode`)
4. Migration validation

**Timeline:** After 1-2 weeks of production validation with dual-write enabled.

**Dependencies:** M2.7 (Testing & Validation)
